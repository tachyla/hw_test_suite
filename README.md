  Latest software bug fixes (Sanity)


  P1 - the most important negative test cases for the feature
  **These negative tests describe how atypical uses and invalid input types are handled within the platform.**


  P2 - other less important negative or corner test cases for the future
  **These corner tests describe extreme cases that most users won't encounter as a result of varied environments such as phone model, operating system version, and/or language internationalization and the way the platform eloquently handles them.**
